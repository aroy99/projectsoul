say Hello! Welcome to the world of Project \nSoul. If you didn't know this was made \nby Cuads, Jpags, JChainz, Antoine,


say Andre, and the one and only RoyBoy. \nAlthough you may not know me, I can \nassure you I am completely talking
say out of my head, and not from a script \nthat the makers of this game \ncreated. 

say Now that we have that settled let me \nintroduce you to some of the basic \ncontrols. First we have set the \pmovement keys to the UP DOWN LEFT \nRIGHT keys respectively.


say Now I'm not going to say anything \nabout that, but the word around the \ncorner is that other companies use \pW A S D. You should check out...


say I have been informed to stop talking \nabout other games and to focus on \nteaching you about this one, so \pmy apologies.


say Alright you can try out moving by \npressing the UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT \nkeys, talk to me again when you \pwant to progress.
